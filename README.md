## OCR-Calculator

#### Task 1:
- Read the image using OpenCV
- Make a Tkinter app to read the image
- Make a raw file that consist of some trigonometric function, with their result.
- Use Pytessact to extract the text from the image, and save it as string
- Make the functionality that take trigonometric function as input, and gives the result of that trigonometry functions.

        e.g 1 
          Input : sin^2x + cos^2x
          Output : 1

        e.g 2
          Input : sin(pie/2)
          Output : 1 
- If there are more than one result, then show all the result. (Optional)


**Note : Add Checkpoints after completion of task.**
